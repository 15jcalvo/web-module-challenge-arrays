## Introduction

When Baskin Robins, a global chain of ice cream parlors, first opened in 1945 they served 31 flavors of Ice Cream. They have grown to almost 6,000 franchises world wide and have became famous for serving 31 flavors at a time. Since they first opened, they no longer serve the same 31 flavors, but they do always have exactly 31 ice cream flavors available.

Your challenge today will be to work with Baskin Robins ice cream flavor array to access, remove, and add flavors, all while ensuring the length never exceeds 31.
